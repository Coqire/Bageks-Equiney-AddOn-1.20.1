# Bagek's Equiney Add-On
Bagek's add-on mod is a mod that brings new blocks, items for people who want more equestrian things. This mod also adds new variants of the SWEM tack without replacing any of the original tack.

### ***About The Mod***
Bagek's Equiney Add-On *{BEAOM}* is a mod that is both an addon and its own mod. It brings more variety of new tack for SWEM horses.

*All* tack and *most* items/blocks in this mod will be eventually crafted using either Sunburst, Equium or Coralarite, which can be found in caves, creative mode or loot chests.
All items/blocks will eventually be able to be crafted and available to view in JEI.

Besides the new tack the equiney add-on will bring new items/blocks like;

♞ more jumps  
♞ barrels  
♞ poles  
♞ and more

**This mod will be created for 1.18.2 and 1.20.1**

All these new models I made myself (unless specified in CREDITS).

### Thankyou to our helpers for putting time into this mod alongside myself.
